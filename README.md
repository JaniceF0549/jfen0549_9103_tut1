### Details
路I choose audio to drive my individual code.

路I animated the environment and the apple tree itself. Specifically, as follows:
I changed the color tone of the background and created a gradient background color changing from winter to spring.
I added new content snow which is related to music.I increased snowfall, snow accumulation and snow melting.
In addition, I also changed the size of the apple tree. The growth rate is also related to music.
My other team members focused on changing the size and movement of the apple tree.

路My inspiration comes from natural phenomena:Visual characteristics of winter and spring alternation.The accumulation and melting of snow are typical images of the transition from winter to spring.

路In order to implement my animation, I sought the help of AI and friends. After understanding how each part of the code works, I added detailed comments inside the code.
